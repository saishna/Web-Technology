                Photographer Payton Pitts has a distinct personal style that expresses itself through her About page. Her colloquial language is lively and approachable, important qualities that people take into account when hiring a professional photographer. 

Paytonâ€™s charming content allows audiences to connect with her: the section of fun facts about herself is a fantastic touch and her personable nature is underscored by genial photographs throughout the page. 

The use of parallax scrolling enables Payton to incorporate many elements onto one page without it looking too busy. And should a visitor to the page want more information about the photographer, they can click on her social media account profiles, or follow the subtle link to her testimonials section. </p>
