                First impressions are everything, especially when it comes to creating a website. The first thing potential customers will want when they visit your site is to understand who you are, what you do, and why you do it. A compelling About Us page is the best way to communicate this information and has the potential to turn website visitors into loyal customers.

The best About Us pages are informative, stylish and distinguish you from your competitors. When adding an About Us page to your website, you’ll want to include important aspects of your business’s story, such as when, why and how it started, its mission, and the overall approach to your work. Your page should also reflect your brand’s style, by employing a tone of voice and design that are unique to its identity. 

While portraying the entire story of your brand on just one page is a challenging task, it’s a worthwhile investment. That’s why we’ve compiled a list of the best About Us pages created by Wix users to inspire you. Use these examples to guide you while creating an About Us page that is as outstanding and professional as you are.
